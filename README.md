# Pastanaga UI - The new UX framework for editing the web

Pastanaga UI is a new user experience framework for the web. It has been created by Albert Casado (@albertcasado) and it is maintained by the Plone community.

This repo contains UI/UX specs for Pastanaga UI. There's a Zeplin repository with more mockups, if you are working on any Pastanaga implementation and want to have access to it, please ask to @tisto or @sneridagh.

# Pastanaga UI icons

There is an initial release of the Pastanaga icons on https://github.com/plone/pastanaga-icons. These icons are intended to be used only in "official" Pastanaga UI, so please refrain to use them on personal projects unless they are based on Pastanaga UI.
